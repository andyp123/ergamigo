ABOUT
-----------
PyRow is python code that allows one to interact with a Concept 2 Rowing Ergometer PM3 or PM4 monitor using python.  PyRow sends and receives information from the Ergometer using csafe commands or built in functions (listed below).  The goal of PyRow is to allow for multiple platforms to have easy access to the Ergometer.

For an explanation of the csafe commands please use the following documentation:
- Concept2 PM Communication Interface Definition [http://www.concept2.com/us/service/software/sdk/default.asp] *Need to download the SDK to get the document
- Communications Specification for Fitness Equipment [http://www.fitlinxx.com/CSAFE/]

REQUIREMENTS
------------
PyRow has been tested on a Windows machine with the software versions listed below, PyRow should be able to work on any machine that can run Python & PyUSB but this has not been tested and confirmed.

Python (Tested with 2.7.2) [http://python.org/]
PyUSB (Tested with 1.0 from github ##/##/##) [http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/pyusb/]
libusb-win32 (Tested with 1.2.5.0) [http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/libusb-win32/wiki]*

*for *nix and Mac libusb is to be used in place of libusb-win32 [http://www.libusb.org/]


INSTALLING
------------
After the software has become stable the software will be packaged as a module.  For now copying 'pyrow.py', 'csafe_cmd.py', and 'csafe_dic.py' into the same directory as your code will work.

Include PyRow in your code with the following line of code:
import pyrow


RUNNING
------------
pyrow.find()
-returns an array of all the ergs currently connected to the computer

pyrow.pyrow(erg)
-creates an object for communicating with the erg, erg is obtained from the pyrow.find() function
 ex: creating a pyrow object from the first erg found
   ergs = pyrow.find()
   erg = pyrow.pyrow(ergs[0])

pyrow.pyrow.getStatus()
-returns status of machine as a number
  0 = 'Error'
  1 = 'Ready'
  2 = 'Idle'
  3 = 'Have ID'
  4 = 'N/A'
  5 = 'In Use'
  6 = 'Pause'
  7 = 'Finished'
  8 = 'Manual'
  9 = 'Offline'

pyrow.pyrow.getMonitor(forceplot=False)
-returns data from the monitor in dictionary format, keys listed below with descriptions
  time = Monitor time in seconds
  distance = Monitor distance in meters
  spm = Strokes per Minute
  power = Power in watts
  pace = /500m pace
  calhr = Calories Burned per Hours
  calories = Total Calories Burned
  heartrate = Current Heart Rate
  status = Machine Status
 If keyvalue forceplot is set to true
  forceplot = Force Plot Data
  strokestate = Stroke State

pyrow.pyrow.getForcePlot()
-returns force plot data and stroke state in dictionary format, keys listed below with descriptions
  forceplot = Force Plot Data (array varying in length from 0 to 16)
  strokestate = Stroke State
  status = Machine status

pyrow.pyrow.getWorkout()
-returns data related to the overall workout in dictionary format, keys listed below with descriptions
  userid = User ID
  type = Workout Type
  state = Workout State
  inttype = Interval Type
  intcount = Workout Interval Count
  status = Machine Status

pyrow.pyrow.getErg()
-returns non workout related data about the erg in dictionary format, keys listed below with descriptions
  mfgid = Manufacturing ID
  cid = CID
  model = Erg Model
  hwversion = Hardware Version
  swversion = Software Version
  serial = Ascii Serial Number
  maxrx = Max Rx Frame
  maxtx = Max Tx Frame
  mininterframe = Min Interframe
  status = Machine status

pyrow.pyrow.setClock()
-sets the clock on the erg equal to the clock on the computer

pyrow.pyrow.setWorkout()
-if machine is in the ready state function will set the workout and display the start workout screen, allowable parameters are listed below (the current PM SDK does not allow for setting invervaled workouts)

 Chose one
  program = number from 0 to 10 (15 if the log card is installed), 1 thru 10 relate to workouts saved in the monitor
  time= [hours, minutes, seconds], min allowable is 20 sec & max allowable is 9:59:59 
  distance= meters, min allowable is 100 and max allowable is 20000

 Not required, can only chose if time or distance is set
  split= seconds if time is set or meters if distance is set, must be less than the total goal and greater
         than or equal to 20 seconds or 100 meters, cannot occur more then 30 times during the workout, time
         has a resolution of .01 sec

 Not required, chose one
  pace= seconds for pace boat to complete 500 meters (/500m)
  powerpace= watts for pace boat to generate
  calpace= cal/hour for pace boat to burn

 ex: set a 2000m workout with a 500m split and a pace boat with a 2 minute pace (120 seconds)
  erg.setWorkout(distance=2000, split=500, pace=120)


pyrow.pyrow.send(command)
-sends a csafe command to the rowing machine and returns the result, command is an array
 results are returned as a dictionary with the key being the csafe command name
 ex: setting a workout of 10 minutes with a split of 1 minute (60 seconds)
   command = ['CSAFE_SETTWORK_CMD', 0, 10, 0,'CSAFE_PM_SET_SPLITDURATION', 0, 60]
   erg.send(command)
 ex: getting pace and printing it out
   command = ['CSAFE_GETPACE_CMD',]
   result = erg.send(command)
   print "Stroke Pace = " + str(result['CSAFE_GETPACE_CMD'][0])
   print "Stroke Units = " + str(result['CSAFE_GETPACE_CMD'][1])

FILES
------------
'strokelog.py'
-an example program that records time, distance, strokes per min, pace, and force plot data for each stroke to a csv file

'statshow.py'
-an example program that displays the current machine, workout, and stroke status

'pyrow.py'
-file to be loaded by user, used to connect to erg and send/receive data

'csafe_cmd.py'
-converts between csafe commands and byte arrays for pyrow.py, user does not need to load this file directly

'csafe_dic.py'
-contains dictionaries of the csafe commands to be used by csafe_cmd.py, user does not need to load this file directly
